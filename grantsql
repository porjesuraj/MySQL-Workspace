1. grant

Normally, a database administrator first uses CREATE USER to create an
account and define its nonprivilege characteristics such as its
password, whether it uses secure connections, and limits on access to
server resources, then uses GRANT to define its privileges. ALTER USER
may be used to change the nonprivilege characteristics of existing
accounts. 
eg 
CREATE USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL ON db1.* TO 'jeffrey'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT ON db2.invoice TO 'jeffrey'@'localhost';
ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' WITH MAX_QUERIES_PER_HOUR 90;


Syntax:
GRANT
    priv_type [(column_list)]
      [, priv_type [(column_list)]] ...
    ON [object_type] priv_level
    TO user_or_role [, user_or_role] ...
    [WITH GRANT OPTION]
    [AS user
        [WITH ROLE
            DEFAULT
          | NONE
          | ALL
          | ALL EXCEPT role [, role ] ...
          | role [, role ] ...
        ]
    ]
}

2
Name: 'REVOKE'
Description:
Syntax:
REVOKE
    priv_type [(column_list)]
      [, priv_type [(column_list)]] ...
    ON [object_type] priv_level
    FROM user_or_role [, user_or_role] ...

REVOKE ALL [PRIVILEGES], GRANT OPTION
    FROM user_or_role [, user_or_role] ...

REVOKE PROXY ON user_or_role
    FROM user_or_role [, user_or_role] ...

REVOKE role [, role ] ...
    FROM user_or_role [, user_or_role ] ...

user_or_role: {
    user
  | role
}

Each account name uses the format described in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/account-names.html. Each role
name uses the format described in
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/role-names.html. For example:

REVOKE INSERT ON *.* FROM 'jeffrey'@'localhost';
REVOKE 'role1', 'role2' FROM 'user1'@'localhost', 'user2'@'localhost';
REVOKE SELECT ON world.* FROM 'role3';

To use the first REVOKE syntax, you must have the GRANT OPTION
privilege, and you must have the privileges that you are revoking.

To revoke all privileges, use the second syntax, which drops all
global, database, table, column, and routine privileges for the named
users or roles:

REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES, GRANT OPTION
  FROM user_or_role [, user_or_role] ..


3 .Name: 'CREATE USER'
Description:
Syntax:
CREATE USER [IF NOT EXISTS]
    user [auth_option] [, user [auth_option]] ...
    DEFAULT ROLE role [, role ] ...
    [REQUIRE {NONE | tls_option [[AND] tls_option] ...}]
    [WITH resource_option [resource_option] ...]
    [password_option | lock_option] ...

user:
    (see )

auth_option: {
    IDENTIFIED BY 'auth_string'
  | IDENTIFIED WITH auth_plugin
  | IDENTIFIED WITH auth_plugin BY 'auth_string'
  | IDENTIFIED WITH auth_plugin AS 'auth_string'
}

tls_option: {
   SSL
 | X509
 | CIPHER 'cipher'
 | ISSUER 'issuer'
 | SUBJECT 'subject'
}

resource_option: {
    MAX_QUERIES_PER_HOUR count
  | MAX_UPDATES_PER_HOUR count
  | MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOUR count
  | MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS count
}

password_option: {
    PASSWORD EXPIRE [DEFAULT | NEVER | INTERVAL N DAY]
  | PASSWORD HISTORY {DEFAULT | N}
  | PASSWORD REUSE INTERVAL {DEFAULT | N DAY}
  | PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT [DEFAULT | OPTIONAL]
}

lock_option: {
    ACCOUNT LOCK
  | ACCOUNT UNLOCK
}
